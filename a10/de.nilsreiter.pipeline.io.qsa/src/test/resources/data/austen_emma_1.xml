<PARAGRAPH parnum="3"><PERSON entity="person3" id="named2" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma Woodhouse</PERSON>, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of <PERSON entity="organism0" id="organism0" class="best" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">the best</PERSON> blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in <PERSON entity="organism1" id="organism1" class="world" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">the world</PERSON> with very little to distress or vex her.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="4">She was the youngest of <PERSON entity="organism2" id="organism2" class="daughters" modifier="two" mentionType="nominal" gender="plural">the two daughters</PERSON> of <PERSON entity="organism3" id="organism3" class="father" modifier="most affectionate, indulgent" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">a most affectionate, indulgent father</PERSON>; and had, in consequence of <PERSON entity="organism4" id="organism4" class="sister" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="female">her sister</PERSON>'s marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period.  <PERSON entity="organism5" id="organism5" class="mother" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="female">Her mother</PERSON> had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by <PERSON entity="organism6" id="organism6" class="woman" modifier="excellent" mentionType="nominal" gender="female">an excellent woman</PERSON> as governess, who had fallen little short of <PERSON entity="organism7" id="organism7" class="mother" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="female">a mother</PERSON> in affection.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="5">Sixteen years had <PERSON entity="person8" id="named4" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> been in <PERSON entity="organism8" id="organism8" class="family" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown"><PERSON entity="person5" id="named3" mentionType="name" gender="male">Mr. Woodhouse</PERSON>'s family</PERSON>, less as <PERSON entity="organism9" id="organism9" class="governess" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="plural">a governess</PERSON> than <PERSON entity="organism10" id="organism10" class="friend" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">a friend</PERSON>, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of <PERSON entity="person20" id="named7" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON>.  Between them it was more <PERSON entity="organism11" id="organism11" class="sisters" modifier="intimacy of" mentionType="nominal" gender="plural">the intimacy of sisters</PERSON>.  Even before <PERSON entity="person8" id="named5" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and <PERSON entity="organism12" id="organism12" class="authority" modifier="shadow of" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">the shadow of authority</PERSON> being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and <PERSON entity="person20" id="named8" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON> doing just what she liked; highly esteeming <PERSON entity="person8" id="named6" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON>'s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="6">The real evils, indeed, of <PERSON entity="person20" id="named9" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON>'s situation were <PERSON entity="organism13" id="organism13" class="power" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">the power</PERSON> of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments.  The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="7">Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow-- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.-- <PERSON entity="person8" id="named10" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> married.  It was <PERSON entity="person8" id="named11" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON>'s loss which first brought grief.  It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that <PERSON entity="person20" id="named12" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON> first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.  The wedding over, and <PERSON entity="organism14" id="organism14" class="bride" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="female">the bride</PERSON>-people gone, <PERSON entity="organism15" id="organism15" class="father" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">her father</PERSON> and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.  <PERSON entity="organism16" id="organism16" class="father" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">Her father</PERSON> composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="8">The event had every promise of happiness for <PERSON entity="organism17" id="organism17" class="friend" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">her friend</PERSON>.  <PERSON entity="person9" id="named14" mentionType="name" gender="male">Mr. Weston</PERSON> was <PERSON entity="organism18" id="organism18" class="man" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">a man</PERSON> of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.  The want of <PERSON entity="person8" id="named13" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> would be felt every hour of every day.  She recalled her past kindness-- the kindness, the affection of sixteen years-- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old-- how she had devoted all <PERSON entity="organism19" id="organism19" class="powers" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="plural">her powers</PERSON> to attach and amuse her in health-- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood.  A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed <PERSON entity="person13" id="named15" mentionType="name" gender="female">Isabella</PERSON>'s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.  She had been <PERSON entity="organism20" id="organism20" class="friend" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">a friend</PERSON> and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of <PERSON entity="organism21" id="organism21" class="family" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">the family</PERSON>, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers-- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="9">How was she to bear the change?-- It was true that <PERSON entity="organism22" id="organism22" class="friend" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">her friend</PERSON> was going only half a mile from them; but <PERSON entity="person20" id="named18" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON> was aware that great must be the difference between a <PERSON entity="person7" id="named16" mentionType="name" gender="female">Mrs. Weston</PERSON>, only half a mile from them, and a <PERSON entity="person8" id="named17" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> in the house; and with all <PERSON entity="organism23" id="organism23" class="domestic" modifier="advantages, natural and" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">her advantages, natural and domestic</PERSON>, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude.  She dearly loved <PERSON entity="organism24" id="organism24" class="father" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">her father</PERSON>, but he was no companion for her.  He could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.</PARAGRAPH>
<PARAGRAPH parnum="10">The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and <PERSON entity="person5" id="named19" mentionType="name" gender="male">Mr. Woodhouse</PERSON> had not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits; for having been <PERSON entity="organism25" id="organism25" class="valetudinarian" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="unknown">a valetudinarian</PERSON> all his life, without activity of mind or body, he was <PERSON entity="organism26" id="organism26" class="man" modifier="much older" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">a much older man</PERSON> in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper, <PERSON entity="organism27" id="organism27" class="talents" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="plural">his talents</PERSON> could not have recommended him at any time.</PARAGRAPH>

<PARAGRAPH parnum="12"><LOCATION entity="location12" id="named28" mentionType="name" gender="unknown">Highbury</LOCATION>, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which <LOCATION entity="location11" id="named26" mentionType="name" gender="unknown">Hartfield</LOCATION>, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.  The Woodhouses were first in consequence there.  All looked up to them.  She had many acquaintance in the place, for <PERSON entity="organism31" id="organism31" class="father" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">her father</PERSON> was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of <PERSON entity="person8" id="named23" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> for even half a day.  It was a melancholy change; and <PERSON entity="person20" id="named29" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON> could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till <PERSON entity="organism32" id="organism32" class="father" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">her father</PERSON> awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.  <PERSON entity="organism33" id="organism33" class="spirits" modifier="" mentionType="nominal" gender="plural">His spirits</PERSON> required support. He was <PERSON entity="organism34" id="organism34" class="man" modifier="nervous" mentionType="nominal" gender="male">a nervous man</PERSON>, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to <PERSON entity="organism35" id="organism35" class="daughter" modifier="own" mentionType="nominal" gender="female">his own daughter's</PERSON> marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with <PERSON entity="person8" id="named24" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think <PERSON entity="person8" id="named25" mentionType="name" gender="female">Miss Taylor</PERSON> had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at <LOCATION entity="location11" id="named27" mentionType="name" gender="unknown">Hartfield</LOCATION>.  <PERSON entity="person20" id="named30" mentionType="name" gender="female">Emma</PERSON> smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,</PARAGRAPH>
