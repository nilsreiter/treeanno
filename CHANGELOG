  disappeared. This only happened in the UI, sentences are stored correctly 
  and have not been lost.
- Merging two nodes now enables the save button

0.6.1

- Fixed an issue with the sentence ordering: Sentences are now sorted correctly 
  before sent to the browser
- Fixed an issue with truncation: Items are now displayed fully, because the 
  smarttruncation plugin was very slow. This caused documents not to load at

  the top level

	- don't allow marking a sentence
	- Provide the combined operation of making a virtual node and assigning a 
	  question
	- Translation strings are different

0.5.2

- New document model. Each annotator gets his/her own copy of the document. 
  The copy is created when the document is opened for the first time.

  segmented using LanguageTool. TreeSegments (visible in TreeAnno) can be 
  based on sentences or tokens.

  - Shift+Right arrow forces indentation by creating virtual nodes
  - Shift+d allows removal of virtual nodes if they have no children

  stored as a boolean annotation. Intended use: Marking of difficult cases or 
  things to discuss later
