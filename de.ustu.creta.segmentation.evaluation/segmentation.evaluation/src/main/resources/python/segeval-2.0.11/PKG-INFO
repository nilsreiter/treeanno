        Text segmentation is the task of splitting up any amount of text into segments by placing boundaries between some atomic unit (e.g., morphemes, words, lines, sentences, paragraphs, sections, etc.).  It's a common pre-processing step in many `Natural Language Processing (NLP) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing>`_ tasks.
        
        This package is a collection of metrics and for comparing text segmentations and evaluating automatic text segmenters.  Both new (**Boundary Similarity**, **Segmentation Similarity**) and traditional (**WindowDiff**, **Pk**) are included, as well as inter-coder agreement coefficients and confusion matrices based upon a boundary edit distance.
        
        To see some examples of its usage, `read the docs <http://segeval.readthedocs.org/>`_.
        
        
        Feature Support
        ---------------
        Included is a variety of segmentation comparison metrics, including:
        
        * Boundary Edit Distance (BED)
        * Boundary Similarity (B)
        * BED-based confusion matrices (and precision/recall/F1)
        * Segmentation Similarity (S)
        * WindowDiff
        * Pk
        
        Additionally, B-based inter-coder agreement coefficients for segmentation that are suitable for 2 or more coders are provided, including:
        
        * Fleiss' Pi (i.e., Siegel and Castellan's K)
        * Fleiss' Kappa
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install SegEval, simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
        $ pip install segeval
